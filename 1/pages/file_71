The Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a private medical school in New York City. Founded in 1953, Einstein operates as an independent degree-granting institution; it is part of the integrated healthcare Montefiore Health System (Montefiore Medicine)[1] and is also affiliated with Jacobi Medical Center.
Einstein offers a M.D. program, a Ph.D. program in the biomedical sciences and clinical investigation, and two Master of Science (M.S.) degrees. In 2021, the MD program matriculated 183 students from 9,773 applicants.[2] The median undergraduate GPA of matriculants is 3.83, and the median MCAT score is in the 93rd percentile.[3] 
Einstein was one of the original three MD/PhD programs to be awarded funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1964, and has received continuous funding since then.[4] The program is currently training over 100 MD/PhD students.[5] Following a $1 billion donation to the school by Ruth Gottesman in 2024, the school is tuition-free for all students.[6]
History[edit]
Albert Einstein College of Medicine
Einstein used to be the medical school of Yeshiva University. Samuel Belkin, then-president of Yeshiva University, began planning a new medical school as early as 1945. Six years later, Belkin and New York City Mayor Vincent Impellitteri entered into an agreement to begin its construction with funding from Henry H. Minskoff[7] and Phillip Stollman.[8] Around the same time, physicist and humanitarian Albert Einstein sent a letter to Belkin. He remarked that such an endeavor would be "unique" in that the school would "welcome students of all creeds and races".[9] Two years later, on his 74th birthday, March 14, 1953, Albert Einstein agreed to have his name attached to the medical school.
The first classes began September 12, 1955, with 56 students. The first dean was Irving London. It was the first new medical school to open in New York City since 1897. The Sue Golding Graduate Division was established in 1957 to offer Doctor of Philosophy degrees in biomedical disciplines.[10] The Medical Scientist Training Program, a combined MD–PhD program, was started 1964.[11] The Clinical Research Training Program, which confers Master of Science degrees in clinical research methods, began in July 1998.[12]
The world's first coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in the United States on May 2, 1960, at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Bronx Municipal Hospital Center by a team led by Robert H. Goetz and the thoracic surgeon Michael Rohman, with the assistance of Jordan Haller and Ronald Dee.[13][14]
In February 2015, Yeshiva University announced the transfer of ownership of Einstein to the Montefiore Health System, in order to eliminate a large deficit from the university's financial statements. The medical school accounted for approximately two-thirds of the university's annual operating deficits, which had reached about $100 million before the announcement.[15] On September 9, 2015, the agreement between Yeshiva and Montefiore was finalized, and financial and operational control of Albert Einstein College of Medicine was transferred to Montefiore.[16][17] Yeshiva University continued to grant Einstein's degrees until 2018, as the medical school achieved independent degree-granting authority in the spring of 2019.[18][19]
In February 2024, Ruth Gottesman, who had been a long-time professor at the medical school and is head of the board of trustees, donated $1 billion to the school to make free tuition available to all students in perpetuity.[6]
Student body[edit]
There are 183 first-year medical students in the Class of 2025. 9,773 people applied for seats, and 1,200 were interviewed. 60% of the class identify as women and 20% identify with groups underrepresented in medicine. Ages range from 21 to 34 with an average age of 23.5. 16% of students were born outside the United States and students come from 17 U.S. states. Students have an excellent track record of volunteer service.[20]
Academics[edit]
A peer-reviewed publication in the official journal for the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) found that Einstein ranked 13th among top U.S. medical schools for graduate success in academic medicine and biomedical research (i.e., awards, publications, grants, and clinical trials from 60 years of graduate outcomes analysis up to 2015). [21][22] Its NIH funding per investigator ranked 7th among US universities in 2019.[23][24]
MD program[edit]
Applicants are expected to demonstrate a solid foundation in science, but there is no strict requirement on which prerequisite courses must be taken. This "competency-based" approach also provides candidates greater flexibility, for example, by substituting laboratory experience gained, while employed, for laboratory and or course requirements taken in school, or by substituting online courses that free up time to pursue interests that enhance the applicant's level of maturity and readiness for the medical profession.[25][26]
Medical Scientist Training Program[edit]
Einstein's Medical Scientist Training Program was one of the original three programs funded by the NIH in 1964, and has been funded continuously since then.[27] The program is designed to train investigators who could bridge the gap between basic science and clinical research by providing integrated graduate and clinical training. Einstein's program offers an integrated first-year curriculum covering both graduate and medical coursework. Second-year students complete the second year M.D. curriculum while working to select a Ph.D. thesis advisor. After performing one clinical clerkship, students commence their thesis research while completing any remaining coursework required for their graduate department. Students are expected to publish at least one first author, peer-reviewed paper. On average, students publish two first-author papers and four papers. After defending their dissertation, students complete the required clinical clerkships then have the opportunity to take "fourth-year" electives.[28]  While on dissertation status, students have the opportunity to attend a continuity clinic which ensures they stay in touch with patients and the clinical atmosphere.[29]
Since the first graduating class in 1961, the Graduate Division of Biomedical Sciences has trained over 1600 students, including 400 M.D./Ph.D. students. The average time to complete the degree is 5.8 years, and students produce an average of four peer-reviewed papers and two first-author peer-reviewed papers.[30] Students do not apply to a specific department, but rather to the Ph.D. program as a whole, permitting them to rotate across laboratories and disciplines to make an informed choice regarding their thesis laboratory.
Master's degree programs[edit]
The Clinical Research Training Program, founded in 1998, leads to the awarding of the Master of Science in Clinical Research Methods. This program involves spending one year after clerkships and some elective time during the fourth year completing courses in clinical research methods and driving a mentor-guided research project that leads to two first-author manuscripts. This program is offered at no additional cost to medical students and fellowship stipends are available.[31]
In partnership with The Cardozo School of Law, Einstein offers a Master of Science in Bioethics that focuses on transnational work in bioethics to help professionals improve care and communication.[32]
PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences[edit]
Applicants apply directly to the PhD program, not to a specific department. This allows graduate students to gain exposure many areas of research before making an informed decision about the thesis work.[33] There are more than 200 biomedical laboratories for students to choose.[34]
PhD Program in Clinical Investigation[edit]
The Ph.D. concentration in Clinical Investigation provides advanced training that prepares students for an independent research career in clinical and translational science. It is offered for Ph.D. students enrolled in Einstein’s graduate division and for M.D./Ph.D. students in Einstein’s Medical Scientist Training Program.[35]
